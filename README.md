# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Purpose
A simple React app to help me remember a deck of cards.
This uses [major system](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Card_Memorization_Techniques/) to associate cards with visual images.
